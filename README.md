# Minesweeper in C

I had a C programming class for engineers in college which gave us a core understanding of procedural programming; it was a beginner course which focused on syntax and debugging to get a working program and barely discussed efficiency, security, or memory management. In this project I am using a simple game to explore these important principles and craft more elegant solutions. This game is functional, however I am still making improvements and working out bugs that do not affect functionality.
